/**
 * Storefront boundary check.
 *
 * A guardrail, not a security sandbox: these files are ordinary application
 * source with full build-time authority. What it buys is a fast, specific error
 * when a presentation edit reaches for something that is not presentation —
 * a database module, a runtime binding, request state.
 *
 * Two policies, selected by path, because store-owned templates and core
 * controls have opposite jobs:
 *
 *   store-owned templates  deny-by-default allowlist. They compose models and
 *                          controls and nothing else.
 *   core controls          denylist. They exist to ENCAPSULATE core behavior,
 *                          so they may use pure helpers; what they must never
 *                          do is read bindings, query D1, or touch checkout.
 *
 * Both reject request-context access, which is what keeps every exposed piece
 * renderable from props alone.
 *
 * Checking is TRANSITIVE. A control that imports a local helper which imports
 * `cloudflare:workers` is exactly as binding-aware as one that imports it
 * directly, and inspecting only the first hop would let that through. The
 * reported error names the whole chain, because "this control is binding-aware"
 * is not actionable without knowing which hop introduced it.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-themes.mjs [dir...]
