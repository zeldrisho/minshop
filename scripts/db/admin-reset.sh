# Forgot the admin password? This clears the `admin_password_hash` row from the
# `settings` table, which drops the store back into BOOTSTRAP mode — /admin/setup
# reopens so you can set a new password (see src/middleware.ts).
#
#   Usage:  scripts/db/admin-reset.sh [--remote] [--yes]
#   --remote: target the DEPLOYED D1 (default: the local .wrangler/state store).
#   --yes:    skip the confirmation prompt.
#
# Requires Cloudflare account access (wrangler) — only the store owner can run it;
# it is NOT a public "forgot password" endpoint. After running, open /admin/setup
# and set a new password promptly (the wizard is open until you do).
