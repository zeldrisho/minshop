# Reset a store's DATA back to a fresh install — WITHOUT destroying or reprovisioning
# the instance. Empties every app table (products, orders, customers, categories,
# images metadata) AND the settings table — which clears all dashboard config, the
# encrypted provider keys, and the admin password — so the setup wizard reappears.
# The D1 database, R2 bucket, Worker, and current deploy all stay; the schema and
# migration history are untouched (no re-migrate needed). Re-seed demo data with
# --seed.
#
#   Usage:  scripts/db/reset.sh [--remote] [--seed] [--yes]
#   --remote: target the DEPLOYED D1 (default: the local .wrangler/state store).
#   --seed:   load ./db/seeds/seed.sql after clearing.
#   --yes:    skip the confirmation prompt.
#
# ⚠  IRREVERSIBLE — deletes ALL products, orders, and settings in the target store.
#    Note: R2 image blobs are left (orphaned, harmless — overwritten on re-upload).
