# Seeds a BROWSABLE local instance with every storefront state.
#
# The equivalence gate already builds these shapes, but in a throwaway database
# nobody can open. Customizing a template you cannot see most of the branches of
# is the problem this solves: without it, a developer editing ProductDetail has
# no variants, no extras, no gallery, and no low-stock product to look at —
# which is exactly the situation on the live demo today.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/seed-storefront-states.sh [scenario]
#
# Scenarios set store-wide state that cannot coexist in one render:
#   default        cart and buy-now on, demo rail available
#   cart-off       browse-only catalog
#   buy-now-off    cart only, no instant purchase
#   no-payment     no rail can take money, so buy-now disappears entirely
#
# Re-runnable. The SQL fixture guards its own inserts, and each scenario resets
# the settings it owns before applying its own.

Seeded. Routes worth looking at (vp run dev):

  /                                catalog, first card is the LCP image
  /products?sort=price&dir=asc     sort links
  /products?page=2                 pagination
  /categories/apparel              category listing
  /search?q=sample                 search results
  /search?q=zzzznomatch            empty search
  /products/sample-tee             variants, extras, multi-image gallery
  /products/pagination-item-2      plain product, no options
  /products/pagination-item-1      sold out
  /products/pagination-item-5      low stock
  /products/pagination-item-3      row currency differs from the store's
  /pages/about                     content page
  /cart  /checkout  /account       shell on transactional and auth routes
  /no-such-page                    404

Re-run with a scenario to change store-wide state:
  bash scripts/seed-storefront-states.sh cart-off
  bash scripts/seed-storefront-states.sh buy-now-off
  bash scripts/seed-storefront-states.sh no-payment
