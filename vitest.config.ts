// Astro-aware but config-file-free. `getViteConfig` is what compiles `.astro`
// components, so storefront presentation contracts can be rendered through
// AstroContainer instead of only through a built Worker. `configFile: false`
// keeps astro.config.mjs — and with it the Cloudflare adapter and its bindings —
// out of the unit suite, which is what the previous standalone `defineConfig`
// was protecting. Pure-function tests still run in plain Node.
//
// Because astro.config.mjs is skipped, the #theme alias it declares does
// NOT exist here. It has to be resolved again from the same helper, or the
// contract suite would test whichever theme happens to be first on disk instead
// of the selected one. Run one theme per process (THEME=<id> vitest run):
// looping ids inside a single run re-uses the module cache and silently
// re-tests the first.
// Generate the per-theme artifacts before resolving: the root tsconfig extends
// generated tsconfig.theme.json, so on a fresh checkout the documented
// standalone commands (test:storefront-contract, test:watch) would otherwise
// die collecting tests with "Tsconfig not found". Safe to run from any number
// of concurrent processes — writes are deterministic and idempotent (see the
// design rule in scripts/theme-css.mjs).
