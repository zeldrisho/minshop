-- 0038: durable, append-only audit history for submitted label attempts.
--
-- shipping_labels remains the single active row and purchase lock for an
-- order. It is deliberately mutable so a definitively failed/refunded attempt
-- can yield to a replacement quote. Money-bearing outcomes cannot live only in
-- that row: the replacement would hide or overwrite the previous transaction.

-- Preserve money-bearing rows created before this table existed. A legacy

-- Status carries over verbatim: purchased stays purchased, and a failed
-- attempt (declined purchase) stays failed — recording it as refunded would
-- fabricate a refund event that never happened.
