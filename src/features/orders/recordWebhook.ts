/**
 * Persist a verified paid-webhook order (idempotent on the provider session id)
 * and fire the confirmation + owner-notification emails exactly once. Shared by
 * the default `/api/webhook` and the per-provider `/api/webhook/[provider]`
 * routes; `paymentMethod` records which rail settled it (for refund routing).
 * Email failures are swallowed — the order is already saved.
 *
 * `settings` is optional but every caller already has it (middleware for /pay,
 * an explicit load in the webhook routes). Passing it removes four D1 reads from
 * the settlement path — the whole-table settings scan plus the three individual
 * lookups whose values are already on `StoreSettings`.
 *
 * `waitUntil` (the ExecutionContext's, when the caller has one) moves the whole
 * notification pipeline — provider construction, the order/items reads, both
 * sends — off the response's critical path. Best-effort by design: sends were
 * already swallowed on failure, so backgrounding them weakens nothing the
 * caller could observe. Callers that need delivery attempted before they
 * answer (the provider webhook routes, whose retries are the safety net) simply
 * don't pass it.
