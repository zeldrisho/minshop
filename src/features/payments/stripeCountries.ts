/**
 * Which countries Stripe Checkout will collect an address for.
 *
 * A "rest of world" zone carries no explicit codes, and an EMPTY
 * `allowed_countries` is an API error rather than "anywhere" — so the catch-all is
 * expanded here, at the provider boundary, instead of leaking Stripe's limits into
 * the zone calculator.
 *
 * Split out of `stripe.ts` so it stays pure: no SDK client, no Worker env, so both
 * unit tests and scripts/check/check-stripe-countries.mjs can load it directly.
