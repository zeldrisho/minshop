// Applying a provider's refund event to an order.
//
// The order of operations matters more than it looks. The verified event is
// persisted BEFORE the order is resolved, so an event we can't correlate yet
// (a legacy order with no stored PaymentIntent) is never lost and the provider
// is never made to retry a perfectly valid event forever. Only a failure to
// persist is worth a 500 — that is the one case where a retry helps.
