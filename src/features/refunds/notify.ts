/**
 * Tell the customer about a refund we just recognised.
 *
 * Shared by every path that can advance a refund total — the provider webhook,
 * the admin actions, and the reconciliation retry — because "who sends the
 * email" is precisely the thing that goes wrong when each path keeps its own
 * copy: a minshop-initiated refund whose webhook is a deliberate no-op, or a
 * retry that finally applies a refund, must still mail exactly once.
 *
 * Rules, in one place:
 *  - Only when the total actually ADVANCED, and only for that delta — so a
 *    replay (which advances nothing) is silent and successive partials read as
 *    distinct amounts rather than one growing number.
 *  - Never for demo orders; they never took money.
 *  - A send failure is logged, never propagated: the accounting has committed
 *    and must not be unwound by a mail problem.
