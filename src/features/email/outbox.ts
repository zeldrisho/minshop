 *
 * Delivery is at-least-once by choice — a row is marked 'sent' only after the
 * send succeeds, so a crash in between can duplicate (Resend's idempotency key
 * absorbs that for 24h; the Cloudflare binding has no equivalent). The claim
 * is a conditional UPDATE, so the concurrent deliverers — settlement itself,
 * a webhook redelivery, the piggyback sweep — cannot double-send a live row.
 *
 * The state-machine SQL itself lives in outboxStore.ts, dependency-free so the
 * reservations integration script exercises it against a real D1.
