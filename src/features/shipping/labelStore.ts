/**
 * The label-purchase state machine (see migration 0034). Dependency-free on

 * against a real database, where the claim semantics actually live.
 *
 * The invariants, in one place:
 * - One row per order (PRIMARY KEY) — the claim that stops double purchases.
 * - Quoting and claiming are CONDITIONAL writes gated on the order still being
 *   paid, unfulfilled, and a delivery (not pickup) order — the page's display
 *   logic is convenience, these guards are the enforcement.
 * - An ambiguous provider outcome parks the row in 'uncertain' and nothing
 *   retries it automatically; provider reconciliation or an explicit
 *   risk-bearing override is required.
 * - Every settled submitted attempt is copied to shipping_label_attempts before
 *   the mutable active row can be reused or removed.
