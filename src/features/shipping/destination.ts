/**
 * The Stripe destination pre-selector, shared by /cart and /express so the two
 * cannot drift: Stripe's hosted page takes a static rate list before it knows the
 * address, so the shopper picks the country first and the session is priced for
 * that zone. The in-app rails (Lightning/OpenNode/Demo) collect the address on
 * /checkout and never need this.
 *
 * The list is Stripe-filtered because it exists FOR Stripe — offering a country
 * Stripe cannot collect an address for would price a session that then fails.
 * And it must be submitted even when only ONE country remains: with the field
 * absent the server falls back to the raw first zone, which may be exactly the
 * unsupported one the filter removed.
