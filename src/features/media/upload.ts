/**
 * Immutable per-upload key. Never reuse one: /images/* is served immutable.

 * Twenty hex characters, not a UUID, because Cloudflare's observability pipeline
 * redacts any run of ID characters in a request URL that reads like a
 * credential: 32 or more hex digits, or 21+ characters mixing upper, lower and
 * digits. A UUID is 32 hex digits (the dashes count as separators, not breaks),
 * so every image request logged as `GET /images/media/REDACTED.webp` and there
 * was no way to tell which file a 404 or a slow response belonged to. Twenty
 * characters sits below both thresholds and cannot match either rule.
 *
 * 10 random bytes rather than a truncated UUID: a v4 UUID spends 6 of its bits
 * on the version and variant fields, so its first 20 hex characters carry 74
 * bits. Asking for the bytes directly gives the full 80 and skips unpicking the
 * dashes. Image keys are public and non-secret, but they should still be
 * unguessable enough that an unpublished product's image cannot be enumerated.
 *
 * Keep this at 20 or fewer characters. Anything longer risks tripping the
 * redaction rule again, and objects already written keep their old keys, so the
 * fix is never retroactive.
