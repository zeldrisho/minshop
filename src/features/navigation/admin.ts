 * different things. It is also the wrong affordance — a merchant building
 * navigation is hunting for one known item, not reviewing recent edits.
 *

 * inactive target still appears in the menu list with its warning; the list and
 * the picker answer different questions ("what is in this menu" vs "what may I
 * add"), so they deliberately disagree.
