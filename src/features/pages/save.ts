 * Persist a page body and rebuild its media associations, atomically.
 *
 * Unresolved media never costs the author their work: the text is always saved.
 * What it blocks is a DRAFT going live with images that would render broken.
 * An already-published page is left published — silently unpublishing a live
 * page because one image went missing is a far worse outcome than one broken
 * image the admin is warned about.
 *
 * The claims and the publish decision go in ONE batch, which D1 runs as a
 * transaction. Writing them separately left a race: media deleted after the
 * lookup but before the claims landed would be skipped silently, and the page
 * had already been published by then. Here the UPDATE decides `published` from
 * a COUNT of the rows the same transaction just claimed, so a claim that lost
 * to a concurrent delete refuses the draft-to-live transition instead.
