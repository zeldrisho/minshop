/**
 * Page layout presets — THE single source of truth.
 *
 * ── Adding a preset ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Add one entry below. That is the whole change:
 *   • the editor's Layout dropdown is generated from this object
 *   • validation accepts it automatically (the union is derived from the keys)
 *   • the storefront and the admin preview both apply it
 *   • no CSS is needed — `measure` and `titleAlign` are emitted as custom
 *     properties that global.css already consumes
 *
 * A preset that needs MORE than measure + title alignment (a tinted background,
 * a different type scale) can additionally target `[data-page-layout="<key>"]`
 * in global.css. The attribute is always rendered, so that hook exists without
 * any extra wiring.
 *
 * Presets are deliberately a closed set rather than free-form width/alignment
 * controls: every combination here is one someone would actually want, which
 * keeps a merchant from building a centred title over a full-width data table.
