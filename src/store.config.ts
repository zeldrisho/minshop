/**
 * YOUR store's settings — the one config file you edit. List ONLY what you
 * change; everything else inherits the defaults in `config.ts`. These values
 * are deep-merged on top of those defaults (arrays replace wholesale).
 *
 * Upstream (the template) never edits this file, so pulling template updates
 * won't conflict with your settings. See `store.config.example.ts` for the
 * build-time customization surface. Common overrides:
 *
 *   currency: 'usd',
 *   images: { maxWidth: 1000 },
 *   orderNumber: { offset: 1000 },
 *
 * Operational switches and integrations belong in Admin → Settings.
