 * Worker entrypoint.
 *
 * `fetch` is Astro's, unchanged — this file exists only so the Worker can also
 * export `scheduled`. (Astro's adapter generates the entry otherwise; the
 * wrangler `main` pointing here is what swaps it. See the Cloudflare adapter's
 * custom-entrypoint docs.)
 *
 * WHY a cron at all: every recurring job in minshop was previously driven by
 * incoming traffic — the notification sweep piggybacks on live settlements, and
 * expired inventory holds are released by the NEXT shopper's reservation. That
 * inverts the risk: the quieter the store, the longer a failed confirmation
 * email goes unretried and the longer sold-out-looking stock stays locked. A
 * store with one order a day could sit a full day in that state.
 *
 * Everything here is idempotent and bounded, because a cron can overlap a live
 * request doing the same work: the notification claim is a conditional UPDATE,
 * and reservation release is guarded per row. Nothing below is exclusive to the
 * cron — it is the same code the request paths call, just on a clock.
