# Storefront extraction-equivalence gate. Boots the BUILT Worker against an
# isolated, deterministically seeded D1 so rendered HTML can be compared before

#
# This is not part of `vp run verify`: a store that has customized its
# templates is SUPPOSED to differ from the default baselines. Run it while
# extracting a default component, or when deliberately updating the default
# design. The checks that must pass for every design live in
# `vp run test:storefront-contract`.
#
# Pass --update to re-capture. Review that diff like source.

# responds — which a cold CI runner can produce — an unbounded curl blocks
# forever, the liveness probe keeps passing because the process still exists,
# and the job dies at its 15-minute limit having printed nothing. A bound turns
# that into a fast, legible failure with the worker log attached.
