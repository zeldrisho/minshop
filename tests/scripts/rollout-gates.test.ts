 * cannot execute release 1's writers — but it CAN pin the property that makes
 * those rollbacks safe: every reader ships ungated, so an older build still
 * understands and serves what a newer one wrote.
 *
 * A gate added to any reader below turns a rollback from quiet into lossy —
 * a published order_status_url starts returning 404 (which the contract defines
 * as "unknown or revoked", i.e. permanent loss), or a paid order records no
 * entitlement at all. Both fail silently, in production only.
 *
 * Cross-release BEHAVIOUR is covered in tests/integration/reservations.ts, which
 * settles snapshots written in a higher release's shape.
