/**
 * `wrangler d1 migrations apply --remote` splits a migration file itself before
 * handing statements to the D1 HTTP API, and it finds a trigger's terminus by
 * scanning for `END;`. A trigger body containing its own `END;` — from a
 * `CASE WHEN … END`, or a nested `BEGIN … END` — is therefore cut short, and D1
 * rejects the remainder with "incomplete input: SQLITE_ERROR".
 *
 * Nothing local catches this: `--local` applies the file verbatim, and even
 * `wrangler d1 execute --remote --file` parses it correctly. Only the remote
 * migrations path fails, which means the first time you find out is against a
 * production database. Reproduced on wrangler 4.115.0 and 4.118.0.
 *
 * Use `SELECT RAISE(ABORT, '…') WHERE EXISTS (…);` instead of
 * `SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS (…) THEN RAISE(ABORT, '…') END;`.
