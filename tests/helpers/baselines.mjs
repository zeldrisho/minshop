 * Every surface that renders a product card, plus the Layout.astro consumers an

 *
 * The shell is NOT browse-only: moving the header and footer into store-owned
 * files puts them on cart, checkout, payment, and authentication pages too, so
 * those routes are baselined alongside the catalog.
 *
 * Coverage limits, stated rather than implied:
 *
 *   /order/<token>, /pay/<publicId>   absent — both need a real order or invoice.
 *   /account, /account/login          baseline their 303. Accounts require a
 *                                     configured email provider in the encrypted
 *                                     vault, which the fixture cannot mint.
 *   /admin/login                      baselines its 303 to /admin/setup, which
 *                                     is where it goes until a credential hash
 *                                     exists.
 *
 * Those four still render the shared shell in production, so they stay on the
 * manual visual-review list. The redirect itself is worth pinning: a changed
 * status or Location is a routing regression regardless of markup.
 *
 *   /checkout                       baselines its 303 to /cart. With no real
 *                                     payment rail configured the only usable
 *                                     rail is demo, and asking for it makes the
 *                                     route MINT an invoice and redirect to
 *                                     /pay/otk_… — an order created as a side
 *                                     effect of taking a baseline, with a random
 *                                     token that could never compare equal.
 *                                     Its shell needs a configured rail.
