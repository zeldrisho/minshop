// Deliberately .ts: reading source files needs node types, and
// tsconfig.compilerOptions.types is pinned to the Cloudflare types. Same reason
// as boundary.test.ts — see its note.
//
// These are source-level assertions because Layout.astro cannot be rendered
// through AstroContainer: it reads request context and runtime bindings. They
// still catch the realistic regression, which is someone relocating or deleting
// the drawer, or renaming one side of a two-sided hook contract.
/**
 * Remove every <script> block, scanning by index rather than with a regex.
 *
 * The obvious `/<script[\s\S]*?<\/script>/g` is what CodeQL flags as
 * js/bad-tag-filter + js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization, and the
 * complaint is fair on its own terms: it misses a closing tag written
 * `</script >`, and a single non-looping pass over hostile input can be walked
 * through. Neither can happen here — the input is a checked-in Astro file, not
 * user data — but this is a few lines, is genuinely more correct, and leaves no
 * tag-filtering regex for someone to copy somewhere it WOULD matter.
