/**
 * Exercises loadProductDetail itself, not the helper it calls.
 *
 * The earlier version of this file asserted on requirePublicId directly, which
 * would have kept passing if the loader reverted to `public_id ?? ''` — the very
 * defect it was written to prevent. A row reaching a public surface without its
 * public ID is a deploy-order bug, and the page must fail rather than render 200
 * with an empty product_id whose Add to cart breaks later.
